- 👋 Hi, I’m @smruthie
- 👀 I’m interested in computational biology and bio-inspired algorithms.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: ML and sequence analysis
- I'm currently working on a swarm optimization project and a supply chain prediction model.
- 📫 How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/smruthie-r-6131bb120/

Note: I did not use version control for any repository in my profile. I currently use Github only to showcase my coding samples, and save some in private for future use.
